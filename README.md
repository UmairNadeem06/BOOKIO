This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

BOOKIO will be a book-sharing platform where a user can lend out or give away a book for free. If renting out a book, the time span for borrowing can be specified and people looking for specific books can create advertisements. The platform requires the visitor to create a user profile, such that people have an idea whom they are interacting with. Users can create a post for renting out, or giving away, their book(s) and provide details such as time and location of pick-up. When a user uploads a book, the title will be looked up in an open book API such that a description of the book, and possibly other features such as general ratings and comments, can be provided to other users. The main page will have several search and filter options and the books will be listed in an order which is dependent on the location of the user.

## User instructions

The website's latest build is available at <insert-domain-name-here>.

In order to be able to interact with the website, one has to create a user account.
This can be done by clicking on the "Register" button on the homepage.
An account can either be made by using an email and password combination (which has to be verified) or by loging in to Facebook.

Once the user has been authenticated, the user has access to the books upload and display, as well as a personal account page.

## Current state of the app

Here we should state the state of the app before our deploy on Thursday.
